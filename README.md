## The Challenge

This is a .NET 9 Blazor Web App with global server interactivity

We are binding to a component instantiated on the page.

The goal is to have two-way binding between the input field and the component.

When we change the message in the Home page, we want it to update in the component.

Also, when the component changes the message, we want to reflect that change in the home page.

This code looks like it should work, but it doesn't.

How can we fix it?
